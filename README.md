# Planet Simulation in Python

## Overview

This Python program simulates the motion of planets in a gravitational field. It utilizes numerical methods to calculate the positions of planets over time, taking into account gravitational forces between them.

## Features

- Simulate the motion of multiple planets in a 2D space.
- Adjustable parameters for initial conditions, such as position, velocity, and mass.
- Visualization of planetary orbits and positions using a graphical interface.
